# Test-Task-Derjava-project
First tutotrial level for the game named Derjava.

Our hero is an ordinary Russian guy who lives with his grandfather in a hut. To him
you need to learn how to live life, since he just graduated from school, to enter the sharaga, as
grandfather commanded to expel the “Western filth” from the Russian Land.

Test
LIFE AND BOZOTA (MANA)
Health = cockerel.
Mana, aka greyhound = beer.
__________________________________________________________________________
The main character at the start of the game has:
3 health.
3 greyhounds.
__________________________________________________________________________
How health works:
1 hit to the GG takes 0.5 cockerel.
Accordingly: 1 cockerel = 2 regular blows to the GG.
1 super-hit on the main player takes 1.5 pawns.
CLARIFICATION: 0.5 cockerel has not yet been drawn. Therefore, let it be a joke for now
the moment disappears when either 2 regular hits or an ult arrive.
__________________________________________________________________________
How greyhound works and is replenished:
Borzotu only uses SUPER hits.
1 super punch = 1 greyhound = 1 beer.
Greyhound is replenished from normal hits on enemies.
6 hits = 1 Greyhound cell.
CLARIFICATION: The beer is rendered in full. 6 stages of replenishment to a full cell.
TUTORIAL LOCATION AND STROKES
As part of the test, it is necessary to create a full-fledged working level with combat and
use all materials.
The main character must:
1. Move around the location: run left - right. bounce. squatting, “climbing”
to the stall.
Stall = platform.
2. Attack in all animations: simple blow, strong blow, ult.
3. Receive damage in all animations: damage, knockback and death.
4. IN STANDBY MODE GG stands and plays with his rosary. There is an example in the archive
animation.
The base enemy (Ghoul) must:
1. Spam the card adequately. Not out of thin air. A certain amount awaits
stall in the shape of a gopnik. When the GG approaches, the gopniks turn into ghouls.
New ghouls just come out of the edge of the screen. Like in 8 and 16 games.
2. Attack in all animations.
3. Take damage and die.
